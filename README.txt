Smart Page - MVC .NET Paging Search Results with Digg Style Paging

This is an example MVC C# ASP .NET web application, demonstrating
how to page search results using a Digg-style type of paging.

Example:

1 | 2 | 3 ... 10

1 ... 3 | 4 | 5 ... 10

1 ... 8 | 9 | 10

The MVC Html Helper method takes a series of parameter, including
current page, results per page, total count, and link/text customizations
to automatically calculate paging and display the resulting HTML.

You can configure the Smart Page to set the minimum pages before paging displays,
number of adjacent pages, number of non-adjacent pages, and even alter the value
for the page number (in case your search method takes a search result index, rather
than a page index).

It's quite easy to use. Give the demo a try and see for yourself.
